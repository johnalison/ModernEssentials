\textbf{3) General Relativity }\hfill \textit{(8 points)}\\
Are true about general relativity
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] Clocks higher up in a gravitaional potential run faster than clocks lower down.
\item[c)] Measurements made in a uniform gravitaional feild are indistinguishable from measurements made is a uniformly accelerating reference frame.
\item[b)] The bending of light in a gravitational field is an illusion: viewed from far away the light path is a straight line.
\item[c)] In GR, the interial and gravitational mass of an object are not exactly the same in a gravitational potential well.

\textbf{X) Mass }\hfill \textit{(Y points)}\\
Consider three particles A, B, C.
Particle A has 10 \GeV\ of total energy and is moving at $\beta = \frac{3}{5}$.
Particle B has 8 \GeV\ of total energy and 2 \GeV\ of momentum.
Particle C has 12 \GeV\ of total energy and 3 \GeV\ of kinetic energy.
Which particle is the most massive ?
Which is the least massive?

\textbf{X) Nuclear Physics }\hfill \textit{(Y points)}\\

An unstable nucleus A (with mass $M_1$ = 50 \GeV\ and proper lifetime = 5$s$) decays into a photon and another unstable nucleus B (with mass $M_2 = 40\GeV$ and proper lifetime = $1s$).
What is the energy of the photon and the lifetime of nucleus B as observed from the rest frame of nucleus A?
