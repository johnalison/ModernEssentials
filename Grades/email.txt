Dear XXX


Congratulations on completing Physics 3: Modern Essentials.
I hope you found it interesting; it is a lot of fun to teach.

The final grades have been posted.

Your final grade for the course is: X

Let me know if you want to pick-up your graded exam or if you have any questions about the course or grades.

If you have not already done so, please take a minute to fill out the course evaluation.
These are actually really important for small, "conceptual" courses like Modern Essentials.
Administrators are always looking to kill small courses, so if you think this course is useful please take the few minutes to fill out the evaluation.

There should be instructions at the bottom of the email to login to the smartevals system.
Survey should only take a couple of minutes to fill out.

Sincerely,
John
