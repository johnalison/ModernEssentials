\textbf{4) Relation of Quantum Mechanics to Classical Physics   } \hfill \textit{(40 points)}\\ 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]{ 
Show that :
\begin{equation}
m \frac{d^2 \langle x \rangle}{dt^2} = \langle - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \rangle.
\end{equation}
This tells us that the expectation values obey the \textit{classical}  laws of physics.
}
\item[(b)] {
In classical physics adding a constant $V_0$ to the potential energy doesn't change anything.
What happens in Quantum Mechanics? \\ \\
Show that the wave function picks up a time-dependent phase factor. eg: $\psi \rightarrow e^{-iV_0 t/\hbar}\psi$ when $V \rightarrow V + V_0$.  \\ \\
What effect does this have on the expectation value of dynamic variables ?
}
\item[(c)] {
The purpose of this problem is to build your intuition as to which systems have to be treated quantum mechanically, and which can safely be described classically. \\
 
Quantum mechanics is relevant when the de Broglie wavelength of a particle is greater than the characteristic size of the system (d). 
In thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the average kinetic energy of a particle is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T
\end{equation}
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann's constant. 

\textbf{Solids:} The lattice spacing of a solid is $d\sim0.3$ nm. 
Find the temperature below which the free \textit{electrons} in a solid are quantum mechanical. 
Below what temperature are the \textit{nuclei} in a solid quantum mechanical ?
(Use sodium as a typical case)


\textbf{Gases:} For what temperatures are the atoms in an ideal gas at pressure P quantum mechanical? 
(\textit{Hint:} Use teh ideal gas law to deduce d.
Put in the numbers for helium at atmospheric pressure.
Is hydrogen in outer space ($d\sim cm$ and $T \sim 3 K$) quantum mechanical? 
}
\item[(d)] {
In classical physics the energy is a real number. 
Show that for normalizable wave functions the E must also be real. 
(\textit{Hint:} show that $\frac{d}{dt}\int |\psi|^2 dx = 0$ only if E is real.)
